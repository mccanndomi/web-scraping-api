# web-scraping-api
Web Scraping api to fetch 'the people forum' data. Will be used by the web-scraping-app that will handle the front end design. Use puppeteer to fetch the data from the website. Store data in firebase every so often (2 mins?). This will make the data accessable for the web-scrapping-app. Firebase is much faster at fetching data and will speed up process.
